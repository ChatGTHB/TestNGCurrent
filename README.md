## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage
Ensure that you have the necessary dependencies installed and navigate to the `src` directory to set up and execute the test cases.

### 1. Running from XML File
Run your tests from the `testng.xml` file by following these steps:

```bash
# From IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse
Right-click and select 'Run testng.xml'.

# To run from command line with Maven
mvn test -DsuiteXmlFile=testng.xml
```

### 2. Running Test Classes Directly
You can directly run test classes annotated with TestNG:

```bash
# Right-click on the class in IntelliJ IDEA and select 'Run ClassName'.

# To run all test classes with Maven
mvn test
```

- **Data Providers**: Supply data to test methods.
- **Parameterized Tests**: Run the same test with different parameters.
- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Implement POM for cleaner code.
- **HTML Reporting**: Generate HTML reports for test results.
- **Logging**: Integrated logging using Log4j2 for tracking and debugging test execution.

## üîß Configuration
Configuration details can be found in the `testng.xml` file and other relevant configuration files within the project. Log4j2 configuration is set up in the `log4j2.xml` file to provide detailed logging.

### Log4j2 Integration
The project uses Log4j2 for logging purposes. Ensure the necessary dependencies are included in your project and the `log4j2.xml` file is correctly configured for detailed logging. Logging is crucial for tracking and debugging test execution; `BaseDriver` utilizes Log4j2 to log test methods' start, end, and results.

## üìö Documentation

- **Day 07**: HTML Reporting, Logging.

### Utility Classes
- **BaseDriverParameter**: Manages WebDriver setup and teardown, handles browser initialization based on parameters, and includes a login test method.
- **Tools**: Provides utility methods such as wait, success message validation, JavaScript click, random number generation, and list search.
- **BaseDriver**: Includes methods for setting up WebDriver, performing login tests, and logging test methods' start and end.

### Reports
The `test-output` directory contains the results of the test executions:
- **Default Suite**: Includes `testng-results.xml` for standard TestNG results.
- **JUnit Reports**: Contains detailed test reports, including `emailable-report.html` for an easy-to-read summary of test results.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues, please refer to the following common troubleshooting steps:

1. **Verify Dependencies**: Ensure all necessary Maven dependencies are correctly added to your project.
2. **Check Configuration Files**: Make sure `testng.xml` and `log4j2.xml` are properly configured.
3. **Review Logs**: Use the Log4j2 logs to identify and troubleshoot errors.

If problems persist, you may seek help from the community or consult the official documentation for TestNG, Selenium, and Log4j2.
